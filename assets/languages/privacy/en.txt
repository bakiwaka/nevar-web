            We have written this data protection declaration (version 04.04.2022-311988122) in order to provide you with the <a class='adsimple-311988122' href='https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&amp;tid=311988122' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a> and applicable national laws to explain what personal data (in short data ) we as responsible &#8211; and the processors commissioned by us (e.g. providers) &#8211; process, will process in the future and what lawful options you have. The terms used are gender-neutral.<br />
                            <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>In short:</strong> We inform you comprehensively about data that we process about you.</p>
                        <p>Privacy statements usually sound very technical and use legal jargon. This data protection declaration, on the other hand, is intended to describe the most important things as simply and transparently as possible. As far as transparency is conducive, technical <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>terms are explained in a reader-friendly way</strong>, <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>links</strong> to further information are provided and <strong class ='adsimple-311988122'>Graphics</strong> used. We are thus informing you in clear and simple language that we only process personal data in the course of our business activities if there is a corresponding legal basis. This is certainly not possible if you make the most concise, unclear and legal-technical statements possible, as they are often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative and maybe you find some information that you didn't know.<br />
                            If you still have questions, we would like to ask you to contact the responsible person named below or in the imprint, to follow the links provided and to look at further information on third-party websites. Our contact details can of course also be found in the imprint.</p>
            <h2 id='anwendungsbereich' class='adsimple-311988122'>Scope of application</h2>
            <p>This data protection declaration applies to all personal data processed by us in the company and to all personal data that companies commissioned by us (processors) process. By personal data we mean information within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR such as a person's name, e-mail address and postal address. The processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and bill our services and products, whether online or offline. The scope of this privacy policy includes:</p>
            <ul class='adsimple-311988122'>
                <li class='adsimple-311988122'>all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate</li>

                <li class='adsimple-311988122'>mobile apps for smartphones and other devices</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>In short:</strong> The data protection declaration applies to all areas in which personal data is processed in a structured manner in the company via the channels mentioned. If we enter into legal relationships with you outside of these channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.</p>
            <h2 id='rechtsgrundlagen' class='adsimple-311988122'>Legal bases</h2>
            <p>In the following data protection declaration, we provide you with transparent information on the legal principles and regulations, i.e. the legal basis of the General Data Protection Regulation, which enable us to process personal data.<br />
                             As far as EU law is concerned, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of April 27, 2016. You can of course read this EU General Data Protection Regulation online on EUR-Lex, the gateway to the EU -Right, under <a class='adsimple-311988122' href='https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&amp;tid=311988122' target=' _blank' rel='noopener'>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679</a>.</p>
                         <p>We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p>
            <ol>
                            <li class='adsimple-311988122'>
                                <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>Consent</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR): You have given us your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be storing the data you entered on a contact form.</li>

                                <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>Legal obligation</strong> (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we process your data. For example, we are required by law to keep invoices for accounting purposes. These usually contain personal data.</li>
                            <li class='adsimple-311988122'>
                                <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>Legitimate interests</strong> (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR): In the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your fundamental rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we need to process certain data in order to be able to operate our website securely and economically. This processing is therefore a legitimate interest.</li>
                        </ol>
            <p>Other conditions such as the perception of recordings in the public interest and the exercise of official authority as well as the protection of vital interests do not generally apply to us. If such a legal basis should be relevant, it will be shown at the appropriate place.</p>
                         <p>In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:</p>
            <ul class='adsimple-311988122'>

            <p>The fact that we only store personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products is a general criterion for us. This means that we delete personal data as soon as the reason for the data processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to store certain data even after the original purpose has ceased to exist, for example for accounting purposes.</p>
                        <p>If you wish your data to be deleted or revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as quickly as possible and provided there is no obligation to store them.</p>
                        <p>We will inform you below about the specific duration of the respective data processing, provided that we have further information on this.</p>

            </p>
            <h2 id='datenuebertragung-drittlaender' class='adsimple-311988122'>Data transfer to third countries</h2>
<p>We only transfer or process data to countries outside the EU (third countries) if you agree to this processing, if this is required by law or is contractually necessary and in any case only to the extent that this is generally permitted. In most cases, your consent is the most important reason that we have data processed in third countries. The processing of personal data in third countries such as the USA, where many software manufacturers offer services and have their server locations, may mean that personal data is processed and stored in unexpected ways.</p>
            <p>We expressly point out that, according to the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfer to the USA. Data processing by US services (such as Google Analytics) may result in data not being processed and stored anonymously. In addition, US government authorities may have access to individual data. In addition, it may happen that collected data is linked to data from other services from the same provider, provided you have a corresponding user account. If possible, we try to use server locations within the EU if this is offered.</p>
            <p>We will inform you in more detail about data transfer to third countries at the appropriate points in this data protection declaration, if this applies.</p>
            <h2 id='security-data processing' class='adsimple-311988122'>Security of data processing</h2>
            <p>In order to protect personal data, we have implemented both technical and organizational measures. Where possible, we encrypt or pseudonymise personal data. In this way, we make it as difficult as possible for third parties to infer personal information from our data.</p>
            <p>Art. 25 GDPR speaks here of &#8220;data protection through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings&#8221; and means that you always think about security with both software (e.g. forms) and hardware (e.g. access to the server room) and take appropriate measures. If necessary, we will go into specific measures below.</p>
            <h2 id='tls-verschluesselung-https' class='adsimple-311988122'>TLS encryption with https</h2>
            <p>TLS, encryption and https all sound very technical and they are. We use HTTPS (the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure stands for "secure hypertext transfer protocol") to transmit data securely on the Internet.<br />
                This means that the complete transmission of all data from your browser to our web server is secured &#8211; nobody can &#8220;eavesdropping&#8221;.</p>
            <p>We have introduced an additional layer of security and comply with data protection through technology design <a class='adsimple-311988122' href='https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/? uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=DE&amp;tid=311988122' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Article 25 paragraph 1 GDPR</a>). By using TLS (Transport Layer Security), an encryption protocol for secure data transmission on the Internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential data.<br />
                You can recognize the use of this data transfer protection by the small lock symbol <img role='img' src='https://www.adsimple.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/schlosssymbol-https.svg' width=' 17' height='18' /> in the top left of the browser, to the left of the internet address (e.g. examplepage.de) and using the https scheme (instead of http) as part of our internet address.<br />
                If you want to know more about encryption, we recommend searching Google for &#8220;Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure wiki&#8221; to get good links to further information.</p>

            <p>Our website uses HTTP cookies to store user-specific data.<br />
                            Below we explain what cookies are and why they are used so that you can better understand the following data protection declaration.</p>
                        <p>Whenever you surf the Internet, you use a browser. Well-known browsers include Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text files in your browser. These files are called cookies.</p>
                        <p>One thing cannot be denied: Cookies are really useful little helpers. Almost all websites use cookies. More precisely, they are HTTP cookies, as there are other cookies for other areas of application. HTTP cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by our website. These cookie files are automatically stored in the cookie folder, the &#8220;brain&#8221; of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. When defining a cookie, one or more attributes must also be specified.</p>
                        <p>Cookies store certain user data from you, such as language or personal page settings. When you visit our site again, your browser transmits the "user-related" information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are used to. In some browsers, each cookie has its own file, in others, such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in a single file.</p>
                        <p>The following graphic shows a possible interaction between a web browser such as B. Chrome and the web server. The web browser requests a website and receives a cookie from the server, which the browser uses again as soon as another page is requested.</p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
            <p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our site, third-party cookies are created by partner websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Each cookie must be evaluated individually, since each cookie stores different data. The expiry time of a cookie also varies from a few minutes to a few years. Cookies are not software programs and do not contain viruses, Trojans or other "pests". Cookies also cannot access information on your PC.</p>
                        <p>Cookie data can look like this:</p>

                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>What types of cookies are there?</h3>
                        <p>The question of which cookies we use in particular depends on the services used and is clarified in the following sections of the data protection declaration. At this point we would like to briefly explain the different types of HTTP cookies.</p>
                        <p>There are 4 types of cookies:</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>Strictly necessary cookies<br />
                            </strong>These cookies are necessary to ensure basic functions of the website. For example, these cookies are needed if a user puts a product in the shopping cart, then continues surfing on other pages and only goes to the checkout later. These cookies do not delete the shopping cart, even if the user closes their browser window.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>Appropriate cookies<br />
                            </strong>These cookies collect information about user behavior and whether the user receives any error messages. In addition, these cookies are also used to measure the loading time and behavior of the website in different browsers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>Targeting Cookies<br />
                            </strong>These cookies ensure a better user experience. For example, entered locations, font sizes or form data are saved.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>Advertising cookies<br />
                </strong>These cookies are also called targeting cookies. They are used to provide the user with individually tailored advertising. This can be very useful, but also very annoying.</p>
                            <p>Usually, when you visit a website for the first time, you will be asked which of these types of cookies you would like to allow. And of course this decision is also saved in a cookie.</p>
                            <p>If you want to know more about cookies and are not afraid of technical documentation, we recommend <a class='adsimple-311988122' href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265'>https:/ /datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265</a>, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments called &#8220;HTTP State Management Mechanism&#8221;.</p>
                            <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Purpose of processing via cookies</h3>
                            <p>The purpose ultimately depends on the particular cookie. More details can be found below or from the manufacturer of the software that sets the cookie.</p>
                            <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>What data is processed?</h3>
                            <p>Cookies are little helpers for many different tasks. Unfortunately, it is not possible to generalize which data is stored in cookies, but we will inform you about the processed or stored data in the context of the following data protection declaration.</p>
                            <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Storage time of cookies</h3>
                            <p>The storage period depends on the respective cookie and is specified below. Some cookies are deleted after less than an hour, others can remain stored on a computer for several years.</p>
                            <p>You can also influence the storage period yourself. You can manually delete all cookies at any time via your browser (see also below &#8220;Right of objection&#8221;). Furthermore, cookies that are based on consent will be deleted at the latest after you withdraw your consent, whereby the legality of storage remains unaffected up to that point.</p>
                            <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Right to object &#8211; how can I delete cookies?</h3>
                            <p>You decide how and whether you want to use cookies. Regardless of which service or website the cookies come from, you always have the option of deleting, deactivating or only partially allowing cookies. For example, you can block third-party cookies but allow all other cookies.</p>
                            <p>If you want to know which cookies have been stored in your browser, if you want to change or delete cookie settings, you can find this in your browser settings:</p><p>

            <p>If you generally do not want any cookies, you can set up your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie is to be set. You can decide for each individual cookie whether you allow the cookie or not. The procedure differs depending on the browser. It is best to search for the instructions in Google with the search term “Delete cookies Chrome” or &#8220;Disable cookies Chrome&#8221; in the case of a Chrome browser.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Legal basis</h3>
                        <p>The so-called “cookie guidelines” have been in place since 2009. It states that the storage of cookies requires your <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>consent</strong> (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). Within the EU countries, however, there are still very different reactions to these directives. In Austria, however, this directive was implemented in Section 96 (3) of the Telecommunications Act (TKG). In Germany, the cookie guidelines have not been implemented as national law. Instead, this guideline was largely implemented in Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG).</p>
                        <p>For absolutely necessary cookies, even if no consent has been given. there are <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>legitimate interests</strong> (Article 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR), which in most cases are of an economic nature. We want to offer visitors a pleasant user experience on our website and for this purpose certain cookies are often strictly necessary.</p>
                        <p>Insofar as non-essential cookies are used, this will only happen with your consent. The legal basis in this respect is Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR.</p>
                        <p>In the following sections you will be informed in more detail about the use of cookies if the software used uses cookies.</p>

                        <p>If you want to view a website on a screen, you use a program called a web browser. You probably know a few web browsers by name: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari.</p>
                        <p>This web browser needs to connect to another computer where the website's code is stored: the web server. The operation of a web server is a complicated and time-consuming task, which is why this is usually taken on by professional providers, the providers. They offer web hosting and thus ensure reliable and error-free storage of website data.</p>
                        <p>When the browser on your computer (desktop, laptop, smartphone) establishes a connection and during data transmission to and from the web server, personal data may be processed. On the one hand, your computer stores data, on the other hand, the web server also has to store data for a period of time in order to ensure proper operation.</p>

            <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>What is Web Analytics?</h3>
                        <p>We use software on our website to evaluate the behavior of website visitors, referred to as web analytics or web analysis. In doing so, data is collected, which the respective analytical tool provider (also called tracking tool) stores, manages and processes. With the help of the data, analyzes of user behavior on our website are made and made available to us as the website operator. In addition, most tools offer various test options. For example, we can test which offers or content are best received by our visitors. For this we show you two different offers for a limited period of time. After the test (so-called A/B test), we know which product or content our website visitors find more interesting. For such test procedures, as well as for other analytics procedures, user profiles can also be created and the data stored in cookies.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Why do we run web analytics?</h3>
                        <p>With our website, we have a clear goal in mind: we want to deliver the best web offer on the market for our industry. In order to achieve this goal, on the one hand we want to offer the best and most interesting offer and on the other hand we want to make sure that you feel completely comfortable on our website. With the help of web analysis tools, we can take a closer look at the behavior of our website visitors and then improve our website for you and us accordingly. For example, we can see how old our visitors are on average, where they come from, when our website is visited the most or which content or products are particularly popular. All this information helps us to optimize the website and thus adapt it to your needs, interests and wishes.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>What data is processed?</h3>
                        <p>The exact data that is stored naturally depends on the analysis tools used. As a rule, however, what is stored is, for example, what content you view on our website, which buttons or links you click, when you call up a page, which browser you use, which device (PC, tablet, smartphone, etc.) you use Visit the website or what computer system you are using. If you agree that location data may also be collected, these can also be processed by the web analysis tool provider.</p>
                        <p>Your IP address will also be saved. According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), IP addresses are personal data. However, your IP address is usually stored in pseudonymised form (i.e. in an unrecognizable and shortened form). For the purpose of testing, web analysis and web optimization, no direct data such as your name, age, address or e-mail address is stored. All of this data, if collected, is stored pseudonymised. This way you cannot be identified as a person.</p>
                        <p>The following example shows how Google Analytics works as an example for client-based web tracking with Java Script code.</p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>How long the respective data is stored always depends on the provider. Some cookies only store data for a few minutes or until you leave the website, other cookies can store data for several years.</p>

            <p>We will inform you below about the duration of data processing if we have further information on this. In general, we only process personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products. If it is required by law, such as in the case of accounting, this storage period can also be exceeded.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Right to object</h3>
                        <p>You also have the right and the option to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers at any time.

For example, you can also prevent data collection by cookies by managing, deactivating or deleting the cookies in your browser.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Legal basis</h3>
                        <p>The use of web analytics requires your consent, which we have obtained with our cookie popup. According to <strong class='adsimple-311988122'> Art. 6 Paragraph 1</strong> lit can, dar.</p>
                        <p>In addition to consent, we have a legitimate interest in analyzing the behavior of website visitors and thus improving our offer technically and economically.

            <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>What is a Content Delivery Network?</h3>
                        <p>We use a so-called content delivery network on our website. Most of the time, such a network is just called a CDN. A CDN helps us load our website quickly and smoothly, no matter your location. Your personal data will also be stored, managed and processed on the servers of the CDN provider used. In the following, we go into more general detail about the service and its data processing. You can find detailed information about the handling of your data in the respective data protection declaration of the provider.</p>
                        <p>Any content delivery network (CDN) is a network of regionally distributed servers, all of which are connected to one another via the Internet. Content from websites (especially very large files) can be delivered quickly and smoothly via this network, even during large peak loads. For this purpose, the CDN creates a copy of our website on your servers. Since these servers are distributed worldwide, the website can be delivered quickly. The data transfer to your browser is therefore significantly shortened by the CDN.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Why do we use a content delivery network for our website?</h3>
                        <p>A fast loading website is part of our service. Of course, we know how annoying it is when a website loads at a snail's pace. Most of the time you even lose patience and run away before the website is fully loaded. Of course we want to avoid that. Therefore, a fast-loading website is a matter of course for our website offer. With a content delivery network, our website loads much faster in your browser. Using the CDN is particularly helpful when you are abroad, because the website is delivered from a server near you.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>What data is processed?</h3>
                        <p>When you request a website or the content of a website and it is cached in a CDN, the CDN forwards the request to the server closest to you and this serves the content. Content Delivery Networks are built to download JavaScript libraries and are hosted on npm and github servers. Alternatively, WordPress plugins can also be loaded for most CDNs if they are set to <a class='adsimple-311988122' href='https://wordpress.org/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>WordPress. org</a> are hosted. Your browser can send personal data to the content delivery network we use. This is data such as IP address, browser type, browser version, which website is loaded or the time and date of the page visit. This data is collected and also stored by the CDN. Whether cookies are used to store data depends on the network used. Please read the data protection texts of the respective service.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Right to object</h3>
                        <p>If you want to completely prevent this data transfer, you can use a JavaScript blocker (see for example <a class='adsimple-311988122' href='https://noscript.net/' target='_blank' rel='noopener '>https://noscript.net/</a>) on your PC. Of course, our website can then no longer offer the usual service (such as fast loading speed).</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Legal basis</h3>
                        <p>If you have consented to the use of a content delivery network, the legal basis for the relevant data processing is this consent. According to <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR (consent)</strong> represents the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as it may occur when it is collected by a content delivery network.</p>
                        <p>We also have a legitimate interest in using a content delivery network to optimize our online service and make it more secure. The corresponding legal basis for this is <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</strong>. However, we only use the tool if you have given your consent.</p>

                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>What data is processed by BootstrapCDN?</h3>
                        <p>BootstrapCDN works in such a way that so-called JavaScript libraries are delivered to your browser. If your browser now downloads a file from the BootstrapCDN, your IP address will be transmitted during the connection to the Bootstrap CDN server. Personal data can therefore also be sent and stored. BootstrapCDN can thus collect and store user data such as IP address, browser type, browser version, which website is loaded or the time and date of the page visit. In the data protection declaration of BootstrapCDN or <a class='adsimple-311988122' href='https://www.jsdelivr.com/' target='_blank' rel='follow noopener noreferrer'>jsdelivr.com</a> It is expressly pointed out that the company does not use cookies or other tracking services.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
                        <p>BootstrapCDN has servers distributed in different countries and your data may be stored outside of the European Economic Area. BootstrapCDN keeps personal data processed on our behalf for as long as necessary for the provision of offered services, as necessary for compliance with legal obligations, resolution of disputes and enforcement of agreements.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Right to object</h3>
            <p>You always have the right to information, correction and deletion of your personal data. You can also contact BootstrapCDN officials at any time if you have any questions.</p>
                        <p>If you want to prevent this data transfer, you can use a JavaScript blocker (see for example <a class='adsimple-311988122' href='https://noscript.net/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer '>https://noscript.net/</a>) or deactivate the execution of JavaScript codes in your browser. Please note, however, that this means that the website can no longer offer the service you are used to (such as fast loading speed).</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Legal basis</h3>
                        <p>If you have consented to the use of BootstrapCDN, the legal basis for the relevant data processing is this consent. According to <strong class='adsimple-311988122'> Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR (consent)</strong>, this consent represents the legal basis for the processing of personal data, as may occur when it is collected by BootstrapCDN .</p>
                        <p>We also have a legitimate interest in using BootstrapCDN to optimize our online service and make it more secure. The corresponding legal basis for this is <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</strong>. However, we only use BootstrapCDN if you have given your consent.</p>
                        <p>We would like to point out that, according to the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfer to the USA. The data processing is essentially done by BootstrapCDN. This can mean that data may not be processed and stored anonymously. In addition, US government authorities may have access to individual data. It may also happen that this data is linked to data from other possible BootstrapCDN services where you have a user account.</p>

            <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>What is jQuery?</h3>
                        <p>In order to deliver our website or all of our individual subpages (websites) to you quickly and easily on different devices, we use the services of jQuery CDN from the company jQuery Foundation. jQuery is distributed via the Content Delivery Network (CDN) of the American software company StackPath (LCC 2012 McKinney Ave. Suite 1100, Dallas, TX 75201, USA). This service stores, manages and processes your personal data. In this privacy policy, we go into more detail about which of your data is processed through the use of jQuery CDN.</p>
                        <p>A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of regionally distributed servers that are connected to each other via the Internet. Through this network, content, especially very large files, can be delivered quickly, even in the case of large peak loads. jQuery creates a copy of our website on their servers. In this way, our website can be delivered as quickly as possible. This means that the data transfer to your browser is shortened by a CDN.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Why do we use jQuery on our website?</h3>
                        <p>Of course we want to offer you a comprehensive and well-functioning service with our website. This includes a fast website. With jQuery, our website can load much faster at your place. The use of jQuery is particularly helpful for users from abroad, since the site can be delivered from a server nearby.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>What data is processed by jQuery?</h3>
                        <p>jQuery uses JavaScript libraries to deliver our website content quickly. A CDN server loads the necessary files for this. As soon as a connection to the CDN server is established, your IP address will be recorded and saved. This only happens if this data has not already been saved in your browser from a previous visit to the website.</p>
                        <p>The StackPath privacy policy expressly mentions that StackPath uses aggregated and anonymized data from various services (including jQuery) for security enhancement and for its own services. However, this data cannot be used to identify you as a person.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
                        <p>jQuery or StackPath has servers distributed in different countries and your data can therefore be stored both in America and in the European Economic Area. StackPath retains personal data processed on our behalf for as long as necessary to provide the services offered, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce agreements.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Right to object</h3>
            <p>You always have the right to information, correction and deletion of your personal data. If you have any questions, you can also contact jQuery at any time.</p>
                        <p>If you do not want data to be transferred, you always have the option of using Java script blockers such as <a class='adsimple-311988122' href='https://www.ghostery.com/' target ='_blank' rel='follow noopener'>https://www.ghostery.com/</a> or <a class='adsimple-311988122' href='https://noscript.net/' target=' _blank' rel='follow noopener noreferrer'>noscript.net</a> to install. However, you can also simply deactivate the execution of JavaScript codes in your browser. If you decide to disable JavaScript codes, the functions you are used to will also change. For example, a website will not load as quickly.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Legal basis</h3>
                        <p>If you have consented to the use of jQuery CDN, the legal basis for the corresponding data processing is this consent. According to <strong class='adsimple-311988122'> Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit.</strong> </p>
                        <p>We also have a legitimate interest in using jQuery CDN to optimize our online service and make it more secure. The corresponding legal basis for this is <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</strong>. However, we only use the tool if you have given your consent.</p>
                        <p>Stackpath also processes your data in the USA, among other places. We would like to point out that, according to the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfer to the USA. This can be associated with various risks for the legality and security of data processing.</p>
                        <p>Stackpath uses so-called standard contractual clauses (= Art. 46. Para. 2 and 3 GDPR). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are templates provided by the EU Commission and are intended to ensure that your data also comply with European data protection standards if they are transferred to third countries (such as the USA) and stored there. Through these clauses, Stackpath undertakes to comply with European data protection standards when processing your relevant data, even if the data is stored, processed and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementation decision of the EU Commission. You can find the decision and the corresponding standard contractual clauses here: <a class='adsimple-311988122' href='https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?locale=en' target ='_blank' rel='noopener'>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?locale=de.</a>

            <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>What is included in "Other"?</h3>
                        <p>The "Other" category includes those services that do not fit into any of the above categories. These are usually various plugins and integrated elements that improve our website. As a rule, these functions are obtained from third parties and integrated into our website. For example, these are web search services such as Algolia Place, Giphy, Programmable Search Engine or online services for weather data such as OpenWeather.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Why do we use other third parties?</h3>
                        <p>With our website, we want to offer you the best web offering in our industry. A website has long been more than just a business card for a company. Rather, it's a place designed to help you find what you're looking for. In order to make our website even more interesting and helpful for you, we use various third-party services.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>What data is processed?</h3>
                        <p>Whenever elements are integrated into our website, your IP address will be transmitted to the respective provider, stored and processed there. This is necessary because otherwise the content will not be sent to your browser and will not be displayed accordingly. It may also happen that service providers also use pixel tags or web beacons. These are small graphics on websites that can record a log file and also create analyzes of this file. With the information received, the providers can improve their own marketing measures. In addition to pixel tags, such information (such as which button you click or when you access which page) can also be stored in cookies. In addition to analysis data on your web behavior, technical information such as your browser type or operating system can also be stored there. Some providers can also link the data obtained to other internal services or to third-party providers. Each provider handles your data differently. We therefore recommend that you carefully read the data protection declarations of the respective services. We make every effort to only use services that are very careful when it comes to data protection.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Duration of data processing</h3>
                        <p>We will inform you below about the duration of data processing if we have further information on this. In general, we only process personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Legal basis</h3>
            <p>If we ask for your consent and you also agree that we may use the service, this is the legal basis for processing your data (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). In addition to consent, there is a legitimate interest on our part in analyzing the behavior of website visitors and thus improving our offer technically and economically. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interests). However, we only use the tools if you have given your consent.</p>

            <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>What is Font Awesome?</h3>
                        <p>On our website we use Font Awesome from the American company Fonticons (307 S. Main St., Suite 202, Bentonville, AR 72712, USA). When you visit one of our websites, the Font Awesome web font (specifically icons) is loaded via the Font Awesome Content Delivery Network (CDN). The texts or fonts and icons are displayed appropriately on every device. In this data protection declaration we go into more detail about the data storage and data processing by this service.</p>
                        <p>Icons are playing an increasingly important role on websites. Font Awesome is a web font specially designed for web designers and web developers. With Font Awesome, for example, icons can be scaled and colored as desired using the style sheet language CSS. They replace old picture icons. Font Awesome CDN is the easiest way to upload icons or fonts to your website. All we had to do was embed a small line of code into our website.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Why do we use Font Awesome on our website?</h3>
                        <p>Font Awesome allows content on our website to be better prepared. In this way, you can find your way around our website better and understand the content more easily. With the icons you can sometimes even replace whole words and save space. This is particularly useful when we optimize content specifically for smartphones. These icons are inserted as HTML code instead of as an image. This allows us to edit the icons with CSS exactly how we want. At the same time, with Font Awesome we also improve our loading speed because it's just HTML elements and not icon images. All these advantages help us to make the website even clearer, fresher and faster for you.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>What data does Font Awesome store?</h3>
                        <p>Font Awesome Content Delivery Network (CDN) is used to load icons and symbols. CDNs are networks of servers distributed around the world, making it possible to quickly load files locally. As soon as you call up one of our pages, the corresponding icons are provided by Font Awesome.</p>
                        <p>In order for the web fonts to load, your browser must connect to the Fonticons, Inc. servers. Your IP address will be recognized. Font Awesome also collects data about which icon files are downloaded and when. Technical data such as your browser version, screen resolution or the time the page was called up is also transmitted.</p>
                        <p>This data is collected and stored for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul class='adsimple-311988122'>
                             <li class='adsimple-311988122'>to optimize content delivery networks</li>
                             <li class='adsimple-311988122'>to detect and fix technical errors</li>
                             <li class='adsimple-311988122'>to protect CDNs from abuse and attacks</li>
                             <li class='adsimple-311988122'>to be able to calculate fees from Font Awesome Pro customers</li>
                             <li class='adsimple-311988122'>to know the popularity of icons</li>
                             <li class='adsimple-311988122'>to know what computer and software you are using</li>
                         </ul>
            <p>If your browser does not allow web fonts, a standard font on your PC will be used automatically. According to the current state of our knowledge, no cookies are set. We're in contact with Font Awesome's privacy department and will let you know as soon as we find out more.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
                        <p>Font Awesome also stores data about the use of the Content Delivery Network on servers in the United States of America. However, the CDN servers are located worldwide and store user data where you are located. In an identifiable form, the data is usually only stored for a few weeks. Aggregated statistics about usage of the CDNs may also be stored longer. Personal data is not included here.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h3>
                        To the best of our knowledge, <p>Font Awesome does not store any personal data via the content delivery networks. If you do not want data about the icons used to be saved, you will unfortunately not be able to visit our website. If your browser does not allow web fonts, no data will be transmitted or stored. In this case, the standard font of your computer will be used.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Legal basis</h3>

            <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>What are Google Fonts?</h3>
                        <p>We use Google Fonts on our website. These are the &#8220;Google Fonts&#8221; Google Inc. The company Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services in Europe.</p>
                        <p>You don't have to register or set a password to use Google fonts. Furthermore, no cookies are stored in your browser. The files (CSS, typefaces/fonts) are requested via the Google domains fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com. According to Google, requests for CSS and fonts are completely separate from all other Google services. If you have a Google account, you don't have to worry about your Google account data being transmitted to Google while using Google Fonts. Google records the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and the fonts used and stores this data securely. We will take a closer look at how the data is stored.</p>
                        <p>Google Fonts (formerly Google Web Fonts) is a directory of over 800 fonts that <a class='adsimple-311988122' href='https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC?tid=311988122' >Google</a> Make your users available for free.</p>
                        <p>Many of these fonts are released under the SIL Open Font License, while others have been released under the Apache License. Both are free software licenses.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Why do we use Google Fonts on our website?</h3>
                        <p>With Google Fonts we can use fonts on our own website and do not have to upload them to our own server. Google Fonts is an important component in keeping the quality of our website high. All Google fonts are automatically optimized for the web and this saves data volume and is a great advantage especially for use with mobile devices. When you visit our site, the small file size ensures fast loading time. Furthermore, Google Fonts are secure web fonts. Different image synthesis systems (rendering) in different browsers, operating systems and mobile devices can lead to errors. Such errors can partially distort texts or entire websites. Thanks to the fast Content Delivery Network (CDN), there are no cross-platform problems with Google Fonts. Google Fonts supports all major browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera) and works reliably on most modern mobile operating systems, including Android 2.2+ and iOS 4.2+ (iPhone, iPad, iPod). So we use Google Fonts so that we can display our entire online service as beautifully and consistently as possible.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>What data does Google store?</h3>
            <p>When you visit our website, the fonts are reloaded via a Google server. This external call transmits data to the Google servers. In this way, Google also recognizes that you or your IP address is visiting our website. The Google Fonts API was designed to reduce the use, storage and collection of end-user data to what is necessary for proper font delivery. Incidentally, API stands for "Application Programming Interface" and serves, among other things, as a data transmitter in the software sector.</p>
                        <p>Google Fonts securely stores CSS and font requests on Google and is therefore protected. The collected usage figures allow Google to determine how well the individual fonts are received. Google publishes the results on internal analysis pages, such as Google Analytics. Google also uses data from its own web crawler to determine which websites use Google fonts. This data is published in the Google Fonts BigQuery database. Entrepreneurs and developers use the Google web service BigQuery to examine and move large amounts of data.</p>
                        <p>However, it should be borne in mind that every Google Font request also automatically transmits information such as language settings, IP address, browser version, browser screen resolution and browser name to the Google servers. Whether this data is also stored cannot be clearly determined or is not clearly communicated by Google.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
                        <p>Google stores requests for CSS assets for one day on its servers, which are mainly located outside the EU. This enables us to use the fonts using a Google style sheet. A style sheet is a template that you can use to quickly and easily change the design or font of a website, for example.</p>
                        <p>The font files are stored at Google for one year. Google is thus pursuing the goal of fundamentally improving the loading time of websites. When millions of websites refer to the same fonts, they are cached after the first visit and immediately reappear on all other websites visited later. Sometimes Google updates font files to reduce file size, increase language coverage, and improve design.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h3>
                        <p>The data that Google stores for a day or a year cannot simply be deleted. The data is automatically transmitted to Google when the page is accessed. In order to be able to delete this data prematurely, you must contact Google support at <a class='adsimple-311988122' href='https://support.google.com/?hl=de&amp;tid=311988122'>https:/ /support.google.com/?hl=de&amp;tid=311988122</a>. In this case, you only prevent data storage if you do not visit our site.</p>
                        <p>Unlike other web fonts, Google gives us unlimited access to all fonts. So we have unlimited access to a sea of ​​fonts and thus get the best out of our website. You can find more about Google Fonts and other questions at <a class='adsimple-311988122' href='https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=311988122'>https://developers.google.com /fonts/faq?tid=311988122</a>. Although Google addresses data protection issues there, it does not contain really detailed information about data storage. It is relatively difficult to get really precise information about stored data from Google.</p>
                        <h3 class='adsimple-311988122'>Legal basis</h3>
            p>If you have consented to the use of Google Fonts, the legal basis for the corresponding data processing is this consent. According to <strong class='adsimple-311988122'> Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit.</strong> </p>
                        <p>We also have a legitimate interest in using Google Font to optimize our online service. The corresponding legal basis for this is <strong class='adsimple-311988122'>Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests)</strong>. However, we only use Google Font if you have given your consent.</p>
                        <p>Google also processes your data in the USA, among other places. We would like to point out that, according to the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfer to the USA. This can be associated with various risks for the legality and security of data processing.</p>
                        <p>Google uses so-called standard contractual clauses (= Art. 46. Para. 2 and 3 GDPR). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are templates provided by the EU Commission and are intended to ensure that your data also comply with European data protection standards if they are transferred to third countries (such as the USA) and stored there. Through these clauses, Google undertakes to comply with European data protection standards when processing your relevant data, even if the data is stored, processed and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementation decision of the EU Commission. You can find the decision and the corresponding standard contractual clauses here: <a class='adsimple-311988122' href='https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?locale=de' target ='_blank' rel='noopener'>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?locale=de</a>
